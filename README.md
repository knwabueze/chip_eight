# chip_eight
A CHIP-8 interpreter written in C++ and SDL2.

### What is a Chip-8?
CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language that was developed in the '70s to run on COSMAC VIP and the TELMAC 1800 microcomputers. This interpreted langauge would run ontop of the CHIP-8 Virtual Machine.

### Why bother creating an interpreter?
I did not create the interpreter for the intent of being the best CHIP-8 interpeter out there. I believe a project like this, which employs knowledge about binary mathematics, basics of computer architecture, programming, software, graphics, and sound as a fitting stepping stone to learn a new programming language (i.e. C++).

### So what exactly does your "chip_eight" do?
This implementation of the CHIP-8 interpreter comes with a primitive debugger, a pause feature, graphics (flickery), and sound (to be added). 

### What technologies are being employed?
* Language: C++
* Compiler + Linker: Visual C++ / MSVC
* Graphics/Audio Library: SDL2
* Platform: Windows
